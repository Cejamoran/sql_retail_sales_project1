# Project Title: Retail Sales Analysis ðŸ›’ðŸ“ˆ

This project is a practical demonstration of essential SQL skills for data analysts. It involves exploring, cleaning, and analyzing a sample retail sales dataset to derive valuable business insights. This repository is ideal for aspiring data professionals who want to build a solid foundation in SQL and showcase their ability to handle real-world data analysis tasks.

# Project Overview

The project is structured to take you from a raw dataset to a comprehensive analysis.

Database Setup: The project assumes a database named p1_retail_db and a table called retail_sales that contains transactional data, including customer details, product information, and sales figures.

Data Cleaning & Exploration: The initial phase focuses on ensuring data quality and understanding the dataset's basic structure. This involves checking for NULL values, counting total transactions, and identifying unique customers and product categories.

Business Analysis: The core of the project uses a series of SQL queries to answer specific business questions and uncover key insights about sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. The queries are well-commented and serve as a practical guide for applying SQL in a business context.

## SQL Code

Here is the complete SQL script used for the project, combining data exploration and business analysis queries.

```sql
-- ===================================
-- DATA CLEANING & EXPLORATION
-- ===================================

-- Select all data from the retail_sales table.
-- Use the appropriate database.
USE sql_project_p2;
SELECT * FROM retail_sales;

-- Verify data integrity by checking for NULL values in the cogs column.
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE cogs IS NULL;

-- Find the total number of transactions.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_sale FROM retail_sales;

-- Count the number of unique customers.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_unique_customers FROM retail_sales;

-- List all distinct product categories.
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

-- ===================================
-- DATA ANALYSIS
-- ===================================

-- 1. Retrieve all sales on a specific date.
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales 
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';

-- 2. Find transactions for a specific category within a date range and quantity threshold.
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing' 
    AND EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM sale_date) = 202211
    AND quantity >= 4;

-- 3. Calculate total sales for each product category.
SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(total_sale) AS net_sale
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY net_sale DESC;
-- 4. Calculate the average age of customers purchasing from the 'Beauty' category.
SELECT 
    AVG(age) AS average_age
FROM retail_sales 
WHERE category = 'Beauty';
    
-- 5. Find all transactions with a total sale amount over 1000.
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000;
 
-- 6. Count the number of transactions by category and gender.
SELECT
    category,
    gender,
    COUNT(transactions_id) AS total_transactions
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category, gender
ORDER BY category, gender;
    
-- 7. Find the best-selling month for each year based on average sale.
WITH MonthlySales AS (
    SELECT 
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
        AVG(total_sale) AS avg_sale
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT 
    t1.year,
    t1.month,
    t1.avg_sale
FROM (
    SELECT 
        year,
        month,
        avg_sale,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY year ORDER BY avg_sale DESC) AS ranking
    FROM MonthlySales
) AS t1
WHERE ranking = 1
ORDER BY t1.year, t1.month;

-- 8. Identify the top 5 customers by total sales.
SELECT
    customer_id,
    SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 9. Count the number of unique customers per category.
SELECT
    category,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY unique_customers DESC;

-- 10. Analyze sales volume by time of day (shifts).
WITH hourly_sale AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        CASE
            WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
            WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
            ELSE 'Evening'
        END AS shift
    FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT 
    shift,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders    
FROM hourly_sale
GROUP BY shift
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;
